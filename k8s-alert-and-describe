function mean:
rate()函数：获取指定时间段的平均量


metric mean:
1，container_cpu_usage_seconds_total	
counter	
秒数
该容器服务针对每个CPU累计消耗的CPU时间。如果有多个CPU，则总的CPU时间需要把各个CPU耗费的时间相加

2，container_last_seen
The container_last_seen metric enables you to query to see if the last time a metric was sent was more that X seconds ago.


3，
container_spec_memory_limit_bytes： 是分配给Pod的内存配额 有等于0的情况


4，container_memory_working_set_bytes
the amount of working set memory and it includes recently accessed memory, dirty memory, and kernel memory. 
Therefore, Working set is (lesser than or equal to) </= "usage".
The container_memory_working_set_bytes is being used for OoM decisions because it excludes cached data (Linux Page Cache)
that can be evicted in memory pressure scenarios.
So, if the container_memory_working_set_bytes is increased to the limit, it will lead to oomkill.




1，KubernetesNodeReady
kube_node_status_condition{condition="Ready",status="true"} == 0
  
The conditions field describes the status of all Running nodes. Examples of conditions include:

Node Condition	         Description
Ready	       True        if the node is healthy and ready to accept pods, False if the node is not healthy and is not accepting pods, and Unknown
                         if the node controller has not heard from the node in the last node-monitor-grace-period (default is 40 seconds)
DiskPressure	True       if pressure exists on the disk size--that is, if the disk capacity is low; otherwise False
MemoryPressure	True     if pressure exists on the node memory--that is, if the node memory is low; otherwise False
PIDPressure	   True      if pressure exists on the processes—that is, if there are too many processes on the node; otherwise False
NetworkUnavailable	True if the network for the node is not correctly configured, otherwise False

If the Status of the Ready condition remains Unknown or False for longer than the pod-eviction-timeout (an argument passed to the kube-controller-manager), 
then all the Pods on the node are scheduled for deletion by the node controller. The default eviction timeout duration is five minutes. 



2，KubernetesPodNotHealthy
min_over_time(sum by (namespace, pod) (kube_pod_status_phase{phase=~"Pending|Unknown|Failed"})[15m:1m]) > 0

5,ContainerKilled
time() - container_last_seen > 60
If you query prometheus for the existence of a metric, it will report stale values for some time after cAdvisor has stopped 
sending metrics for that container. The container_last_seen metric enables you to query to see if the last time a metric was sent was more that X seconds ago.
E.g. if I just did count(some_cadvisor_metric{name=my-container}), it would continue to return 1 even after the container is gone.
Instead, I can do something like time() - container_last_seen{name=my-container} > 30 to see if the container has been gone a while.

6,ContainerCpuUsage
(sum by(instance, name, pod) (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[3m])) * 100) > 80
3分钟容器使用CPU时间平均量，按instance, name, pod分组求和，×100后大于80

7，ContainerMemoryUsage
(sum by(instance, name, pod) (container_memory_working_set_bytes) / sum by(instance, name, pod) (container_spec_memory_limit_bytes > 0) * 100) > 80
使用内存占limit内存大于80%
