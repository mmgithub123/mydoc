By default BIND will install in /usr/local and place files in these subdirectories of it:

sbin - named and all the system administrative tools associated with BIND such as rndc, dnssec-keygen, named-checkconf etc..
bin - tools for non-admin users - you'll find dig, host and nsupdate here
lib - object code libraries
share - (and various subdirectories) BIND's man pages
include - C header files
In addition, BIND compiled with no change to the default directories will expect to use the following directories (relative to /)

/etc - configuration files (such as named.conf, rndc.conf)
/var/run - run-time files created and used by named
