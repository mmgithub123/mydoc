By default BIND will install in /usr/local and place files in these subdirectories of it:

sbin - named and all the system administrative tools associated with BIND such as rndc, dnssec-keygen, named-checkconf etc..
bin - tools for non-admin users - you'll find dig, host and nsupdate here
lib - object code libraries
share - (and various subdirectories) BIND's man pages
include - C header files
In addition, BIND compiled with no change to the default directories will expect to use the following directories (relative to /)

/etc - configuration files (such as named.conf, rndc.conf)
/var/run - run-time files created and used by named

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

install and use

..yum install bind bind-utils
2,You're now ready to run named as a background daemon. Before launching it, 
it's a good idea to set up the default options for the management tool rndc.
..rndc-confgen -a
3,start
..systemctl start named
..netstat -nlp

best Practices  ：

https://kb.isc.org/docs/bind-best-practices-recursive

1，Run BIND on a server dedicated to DNS only
2，Run separate authoritative and recursive DNS servers
3，Choose appropriate software and hardware

Take basic security measures
Run BIND as an unprivileged user.
To open low-numbered UDP and TCP ports BIND must be launched as root, but an alternate uid can be specified using the -u command line argument; 
after opening needed resources named will change its runtime uid to an unprivileged account.

Monitor the service
Put in place monitoring scripts to continually check health of servers and alert if conditions change substantially.

Conditions to monitor include:

process presence
CPU utilization
memory usage
network throughput and buffering (inbound/outbound)
filesystem utilization (on the log filesystem and also the filesystem containing the named working directory)
